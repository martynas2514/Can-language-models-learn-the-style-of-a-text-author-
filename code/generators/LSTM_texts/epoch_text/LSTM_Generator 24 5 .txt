Sanders.  Can youSanders.  Can you believe it? He's the greatest thing.  I don't think they know it.  And I can tell you.  I don't think you know, he was so great, the real thing.  I think they're the worst in the world, I'm going to get down.  It's a good time, and you see this, and I have to do it, but they're not going to do.  I don't want to pay the ballots, it's in the world.  The Republican party is policy, they're not the greatest, you can't do that.  They're not doing well.
