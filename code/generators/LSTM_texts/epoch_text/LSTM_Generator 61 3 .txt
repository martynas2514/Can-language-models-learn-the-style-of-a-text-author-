we saved more thanwe saved more than I do.  So we're doing it.  We're building it.  We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the American people.  We stand to the United States, the Apaches and we don't let that happen.  We're going to win.  I'm not going to do it.  I don't want to get a call.  We're going to have a lot of money to get them.  We don't want to be a little bit, but we're going to win the last time, and it's not a good story.  But I don't like the wall.
