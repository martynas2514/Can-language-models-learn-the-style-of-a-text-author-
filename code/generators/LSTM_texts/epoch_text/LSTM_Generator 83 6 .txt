Joe Biden rally? Well,Joe Biden rally? Well, no, they're not doing it.  He's always going to get up, but he's running the word out of a long time ago.  I'm going to be very angry.  I love you.  I love you.  We've had so many people have, that's going to be a disgrace.  That's a big deal.  But I'll tell you, it's a lot of what's going on.  And they are in the United States.  And I don't like the name of a new ones.  We're not going to win.  We're going to win the Democrats.
