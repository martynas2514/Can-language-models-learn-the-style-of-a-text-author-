 Nobody took it Nobody took it.  I don't think I'm a great guy, and I did a lot of people.  They're really good, very good, very bad, so they're not going to see this guy.  They're not doing it.  They don't do that.  I've been doing it.  They're not going to do it, and they were targeted for the office.  I said, "Sir, it's not going to be. " Because you know what? We're not going to let the wall to be a lot.  They don't have to make it, right? I think it's easy.
