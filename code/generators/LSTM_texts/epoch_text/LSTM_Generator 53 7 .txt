that two days ago,that two days ago, I'll tell you, we are finally putting America first.  We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life.  We will uphold religious liberty, and defend the Constitution of the United States.  We believe that faith and family, and the American people, we will never stop fighting for our great heroes of law enforcement.  We will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again.  We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again.  Thank you, Tom.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you,
