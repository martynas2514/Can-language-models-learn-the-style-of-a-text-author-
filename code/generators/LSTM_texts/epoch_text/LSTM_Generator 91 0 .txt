classic.  I don'tclassic.  I don't think they're doing with the farmers.  I said, "Do you see what's happening.  It's going to be a short time I think. " And we're doing it for a long time.  I'm not doing that.  And the best people are in the history of our country.  They're not going to do it.  We're going to win.  We're going to do it, and they're going to get rid of the wall.  It's a lot of people.  We're going to win that one.  We're going to do it again.  We love our farmers.
