Republicans stuck together. Republicans stuck together.  We will protect your values that bind us together as one America.  We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.  We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement.  We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life.  We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way.  We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag.  And we will make America great again.  Thank you.  Thank you, and we're winning.  We're going to win, but we're doing that
