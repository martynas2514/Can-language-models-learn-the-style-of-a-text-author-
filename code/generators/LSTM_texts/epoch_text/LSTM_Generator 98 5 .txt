But always respect ourBut always respect our great American flag.  And we have a big part of the people that are going to take a look at the United States.  We don't want to pay.  We're doing it.  And they want to let them like you.  And that's what we're doing.  You're not going to do it.  We have to win.  We are going to win Pennsylvania, and we're going to win the great state of Wisconsin.  We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag.  And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto
