What do you think.What do you think.  It's a big deal.  They're going to be finished, we're going to be doing a great job.  We have a lot of people.  We're going to get out and vote.  We're doing it, but we're not going to get it done.  We're not going to have a problem.  And we will protect Medicare and Social Security.  We are returning power to the great nation.
