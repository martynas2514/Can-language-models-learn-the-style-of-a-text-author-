fire was … I'dfire was … I'd have to do that.  They want to get out and vote.  So I'm telling you.  But we're joined tonight by many great police, and we're going to give them $10,000, they're not going to have the opioid epidemic.  We're going to win, you will vote to be a little bit of oil.  We love the farm and they want to see it.  I was to do, and we won't stop that.  They're not going to be going to get out, but we were going to be joined for a wall.  They're not going to do it.
