We're not going to keep on winning.  We will keep on going to keep on winning, your state.  We will keep on winning, winning.  We will make America, one family, one movement, one glorious nation under God.  We will make America great again.  We will keep on winning.  We will make America.  We will make America strong again, we will make America strong again.
